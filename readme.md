# Introducing Project Ret
Project Ret is a cross-platform project I'm working on these days. With Project Ret, you can shutdown your computer remotely even if two computers are not on the same local network.

## RET

RET refers to **Re**mote Shu**t**down.

## Implementation

We used the APIs of Project Rome provided by Microsoft so that we could reach any devices remotely as long as these devices signed into the same Microsoft Account. The APIs in Project Rome enabled the cross-platform application engagement, and they are easy to call on any platform.

However, to achieve remote control, we still need a client on the controlled device. The client registered a URL protocol which accept specified data as parameters and allows remote calls. Correspondingly, the client on the controller side will send the URL launching request through the Project Rome APIs and provide some keys for authentication.

## Security

Since the client will expose a URL protocol publicly, there might be some security risks, we use a security key and device GUID as credentials to prevent your devices from attack.

As for the controller side, we used Windows Hello for authentication. Before enter the controller console, user must enter there PIN or login with fingerprint or facial recognition.
